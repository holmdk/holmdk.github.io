# 19th Conference on Artificial Intelligence for Environmental Science at the American Meteorological Society - Annual Meeting in Boston, MA, 12-16 January 2020.

Today I will be talking about my recent visit to Boston for the AMS Annual Meeting, where I presented my research in Multi-Layer Cloud Nowcasting using Deep Learning on Satellite Images.\
The conference was absolutely amazing - and in this post I will summarize the key takeaways from the various presentations I saw. As a side note - these presentations will be available online at the followingÂ [site](https://ams.confex.com/ams/2020Annual/meetingapp.cgi/Index/Recording~1).
