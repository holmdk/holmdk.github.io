# About

I am currently studying my **PhD in Machine Learning** at Aarhus University, Denmark, where I apply Machine Learning and Deep Learning for **Weather Forecasting and the Atmospheric Sciences**.  

My current research involves **Deep Learning for Multi-Layer Cloud Nowcasting using Satellite Images**. You can read more about this at [Cloud Nowcasting Paper](https://ams.confex.com/ams/2020Annual/webprogram/Paper365696.html), which I recently presented orally at the **19<sup>th</sup> Conference on Artificial Intelligence for Environmental Science at the 100<sup>th</sup> American Meteorological Society - Annual Meeting in Boston, MA. January 12-16, 2020.**



I am **collaborating** with a leading European renewable energy trading company in Denmark called Danske Commodities, where weather forecasting is a significant part of their daily operations.  

On a personal level I enjoy playing music (piano and guitar) and video games, as well as attending the occassional Kaggle or Data Science competition. For the (numer.ai)[https://numer.ai/] Hedge Fund Data Science challenge, for example, I have accumulated around **$4,500 USD to date**.
